# Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts

## Introduction

Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work item of the IETF. They are the
primary inputs into what may eventually be published as a Request for Comment
(RFC).

Internet-Drafts are used by all of the RFC Streams [RFC 8279]. The guidance
in this document applies to all the streams unless it is identified as
specific to a particular stream.

This document collects and summarizes requirements and guidance from 
many sources. The following resources should be consulted 
for definitive details:

  * The IETF Standards Process is described in [RFC 2026].
  * The IETF rules concerning copyright are described in [BCP 78]
  * The IETF rules on IPR are described in [BCP 79]
  * The IETF Trust Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents [TLP], called
    "the TLP" for short, provides many details about copyright policy and
    practice.
