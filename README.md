# Guidelines to Authors of Internet-Drafts

## Introduction

Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) are the basic work item of the IETF. They are the
primary inputs into what may eventually be published as a Request for Comment
(RFC).

Internet-Drafts are used by all of the RFC Streams [RFC 8279]. The guidance in
this document applies to all streams unless it is identified as specific to a
particular stream.

Internet-Drafts are prepared by people acting in possibly several roles, such
as an author or an editor. This guidance uses the term "author", but the
guidance applies to people acting in any role.

This document collects and summarizes requirements and guidance from 
many sources. The following resources should be consulted 
for definitive details:

  * The IETF Standards Process is described in [RFC 2026].
  * The IETF rules concerning copyright are described in [BCP 78]
  * The IETF rules on IPR are described in [BCP 79]
  * The IETF Trust Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents [TLP], called
    "the TLP" for short, provides many details about copyright policy and
    practice.

Much of the guidance in this document is in the form of something that can be
inspected, or checked, to see whether changes should be made before submitting
an I-D. These items are marked with checkboxes ([ ]). However, authors are
expected to be familiar with and to apply the full guidance in this document.

## Background

Internet-Drafts are managed through the IETF Datatracker [DATATRACKER]. 

All versions of Internet-Drafts are kept in the Internet-Draft Archive
[ARCHIVE]. Active versions of Internet-Drafts are also placed in the
Internet-Draft Repository [REPOSITORY].

Versions of Internet-Drafts are removed from the Repository when any of the
following occur:

  * the I-D is updated with a new version
  * the I-D is replaced by another Internet-Draft
  * the I-D is published as an RFC
  * the I-D expires. 

An I-D expires 185 days after the draft was placed in the repository unless it
is in a state that prevents it from expiring. Examples of such states include
being processed by the IESG for publication in the IETF stream, or being under
review by the Independent Series Editor (ISE) for publication in the Independent
Submission Stream.

Internet-Drafts are not removed from the Archive when they are removed from
the Repository. Removing an I-D from the Archive occurs only in exceptional
circumstances, described in this IESG Statement [ID-REMOVAL].

Even though Internet-Drafts are kept in the Archive, they are not an archival
series, and should not be cited or quoted as anything other than "work in
progress".
